# Air Quality Prediction Pipeline  

The goal of this project was to explore whether **meteorological data alone** can be used to predict **air pollution levels in the UK**.  

I built an end-to-end pipeline that collected data from the **OpenAQ API** (pollution) and the **Meteo API** (weather), processed and combined the datasets, engineered meaningful features, and trained models to predict two pollutants: **Ozone (O₃)** and **Particulate Matter (PM2.5)**.  

To make the results accessible, I also deployed an interactive **Streamlit app** where users can explore predictions and trends.

## What I Did  

- **Data Collection**  
  - Pulled pollution data from OpenAQ.  
  - Pulled meteorological data from Meteo.  
  - Created scripts to handle API limits and automatically fetch large datasets.


- **Data Engineering & Feature Engineering**  
  - Cleaned and merged datasets.  
  - Added **rolling averages** and **lag features** to capture temporal dependencies.  
  - Created interaction terms (e.g. **humidity × wind speed**).  
  - Encoded cyclical time using **sin(hour)** and **cos(hour)** to represent daily cycles.  
  - Handled missing values and outliers.  

- **Modeling**  
  - **O₃** → regression model with hyperparameter tuning.  
  - **PM2.5** → a **two-stage pipeline**:  
    1. Classifier predicts whether a measurement is a **peak** or **non-peak**.  
    2. Two separate regressors are used for peak and non-peak cases.  

- **Deployment**  
  - Built a Streamlit app so results can be explored interactively.
